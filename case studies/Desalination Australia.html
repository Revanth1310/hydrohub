    <div class="container">
        <h2 class="section-title">Problem</h2>
        <p class="content">Australia has been facing significant water shortages due to prolonged droughts, which have severely impacted both urban and rural populations. The coastal regions, including major cities like Melbourne, Sydney, and Perth, experience fluctuating rainfall patterns, exacerbating the already strained freshwater resources. These water shortages have become critical, particularly in densely populated areas, where the demand for potable water continues to rise.</p>

        </div>

        <h2 class="section-title">Solution</h2>
        <p class="content">To address these water scarcity challenges, Australia has invested in large-scale desalination plants. These plants convert seawater into potable water, ensuring a consistent and sustainable water supply for major cities. Desalination technology uses reverse osmosis to remove salt and impurities from seawater, making it safe for consumption and agricultural use.</p>

        <p class="content">The Australian government has built and expanded several desalination plants along the country's coastline. These plants are designed to operate in conjunction with other water sources, providing a backup during times of drought. The plants have been strategically located to serve the most populous urban areas, which are heavily dependent on water for drinking, sanitation, and industrial needs.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Outcome</h2>
        <p class="content">The implementation of desalination plants has had a significant impact on Australia's water supply. The plants have become a critical component of the country's strategy to ensure reliable access to potable water, especially in urban areas that are most vulnerable to drought. Desalinated water now contributes a significant portion of the total water supply for major cities like Melbourne and Sydney, helping to meet the demands of both residents and industries.</p>

        <h2 class="section-title">Key Takeaway</h2>
        <p class="content">Desalination has proven to be a viable solution for regions with limited freshwater resources but abundant seawater. While energy-intensive and expensive to set up, desalination offers a reliable long-term solution to water shortages, particularly in coastal areas prone to drought. As global freshwater supplies become increasingly strained, desalination could play a vital role in addressing water scarcity in urban centers worldwide.</p>
