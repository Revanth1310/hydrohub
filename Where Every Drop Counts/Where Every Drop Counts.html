          <h2>Water Issues Worldwide</h2>
          <p>
            Many large cities in India are facing acute water scarcity today, affecting millions of people.
            The data shows that only a few Indian cities have efficient water management systems amidst the
            ever-growing population. This case study highlights the severe water crisis faced in the
            National Capital Region of Delhi and Chennai's Metropolitan area.
          </p>
          <p>
            India faces a deficiency in monsoon rainfall due to climate change, rapid urbanization,
            and lack of proactive water management. These challenges have a disproportionate effect on
            marginalized communities in Delhi and Chennai, where systemic risks lead to significant
            socio-economic and environmental consequences.
          </p>

          <h2>Impact and Implications</h2>
          <p>
            The water crisis impacts socio-economic and political systems at large, causing agricultural
            failures, political conflicts, economic struggles due to business closures, and rising farmer
            suicides. The study suggests proactive measures in urban planning and water management to
            build resilience and sustainability for long-term impact.
          </p>

          <h2>Recommendations and Solutions</h2>
          <p>
            The case study highlights various measures for crisis prevention, mitigation, and preparedness,
            including promoting social behavior change campaigns and capacity-building programs among
            stakeholders. By empowering communities with knowledge and tools, we can pave the way for
            effective water management solutions for the future.
