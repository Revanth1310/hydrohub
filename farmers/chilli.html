      <h2>1. Mechanism of Chilli Cultivation</h2>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Land Preparation</h3>
        <p>The soil is plowed to a fine tilth to promote root development. Organic manure or compost is added, and raised beds or ridges are created to ensure proper drainage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Sowing</h3>
        <p>Seeds are initially sown in nurseries and transplanted when they reach 4–6 weeks of growth. In some cases, seeds are directly sown in the field. Spacing is maintained at 45–60 cm between rows and 30–45 cm between plants.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Crop Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Regular watering is necessary, but chillies are sensitive to waterlogging. Fertilization with NPK, especially nitrogen and potassium, is crucial for better fruiting. Weeding is managed manually or chemically to maintain a weed-free environment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Staking</h3>
        <p>Staking the plants helps prevent lodging, particularly in areas prone to heavy winds or rains, ensuring the plants remain upright and productive.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Harvesting</h3>
        <p>Chillies are harvested manually at various stages, depending on the desired outcome (green or dry chillies). Multiple pickings are required since the fruits do not ripen simultaneously.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Water Usage</h2>
      <p>Chillies require moderate amounts of water but are highly sensitive to both drought and waterlogging.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water Requirements</h3>
        <p>Chillies need approximately 600–900 liters of water per kg, depending on the climate and soil type.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Critical Stages for Water</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Flowering</li>
          <li>Fruit formation</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Excess water can lead to root rot and fungal diseases, so consistent and controlled irrigation is key.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water-Saving Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drip Irrigation: Delivers water directly to the root zone, minimizing waste.</li>
          <li>Mulching: Helps retain moisture in the soil and reduce evaporation.</li>
          <li>Rainwater Harvesting: Stores rainwater for supplemental irrigation during dry periods.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Suitable Soils for Chilli</h2>
      <p>Chillies grow best in well-drained loamy or sandy loam soils that ensure good aeration and root development.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Fertile soils rich in organic matter are ideal.</li>
        <li>The optimal soil pH range is 6.0 to 7.5.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Avoid heavy clay soils or waterlogged areas, which can stunt growth and cause root diseases.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Difficulties in Chilli Cultivation</h2>
      <p>While chillies are a relatively hardy crop, they face several challenges in cultivation. Below are the common issues and suggested remedies.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Pest and Disease Infestation</h3>
        <p>Pests such as thrips, aphids, fruit borers, and mites, along with diseases like powdery mildew, anthracnose, and viral infections (e.g., leaf curl virus), can severely damage crops.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use disease-resistant varieties, implement Integrated Pest Management (IPM) practices, and apply fungicides and insecticides as needed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Waterlogging or Drought</h3>
        <p>Chillies are sensitive to both excessive water and prolonged dryness.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Ensure good drainage to prevent waterlogging. Use drip irrigation during dry spells to provide consistent moisture to the roots.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Soil Nutrient Deficiency</h3>
        <p>Lack of essential nutrients, especially nitrogen, potassium, and micronutrients like zinc and boron, can impact plant growth and fruit yield.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Conduct soil tests and apply fertilizers based on recommendations. Organic manures and micronutrient supplementation can help address deficiencies.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Climate Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>Extreme temperatures, heavy rainfall, and frost can stress chilli plants and affect productivity.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Plant during favorable climatic conditions, and use protective structures such as polyhouses to safeguard plants in adverse weather.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Poor Pollination</h3>
        <p>Inadequate pollination can result in fewer fruits per plant.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Attract pollinators by planting flowering plants nearby, and avoid pesticide spraying during flowering periods.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>f. Weed Infestation</h3>
        <p>Weeds compete for nutrients, water, and light, hampering plant growth.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Regular weeding, both manually and mechanically, can control this. Pre-emergence herbicides can also be used to suppress weed growth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>g. Post-Harvest Losses</h3>
        <p>Improper drying and storage conditions can lead to fungal infections and spoilage of the chillies.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Dry chillies in controlled environments to reduce moisture content, and store in clean, moisture-free conditions to maintain quality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>h. Market Price Fluctuations</h3>
        <p>Chilli prices are often volatile, which can significantly impact farmers' income.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Promote value-added products such as chilli powder and sauces. Also, develop storage facilities to hold produce until market prices improve.</p>
