      <h2>1. Mechanism of Citrus Cultivation</h2>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Land Preparation</h3>
        <p>Citrus plants thrive in sunny, well-drained areas. The soil is plowed deeply and enriched with organic manure. Pits are dug at a size of 60 cm × 60 cm × 60 cm, filled with a mix of topsoil, compost, and fertilizers for proper root development.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Planting</h3>
        <p>Healthy grafts or budded plants from certified nurseries are used. A spacing of 5–6 meters between plants is maintained to allow proper growth and light penetration. Planting is done during the rainy season or early spring to ensure better establishment.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Crop Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Regular watering, especially during dry spells, is necessary for citrus growth. Fertilization with balanced NPK fertilizers and micronutrients like zinc and boron is essential. Weeding is done manually or chemically, and mulching retains soil moisture and prevents weed growth.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Pruning and Training</h3>
        <p>Pruning removes dead and diseased branches, improving air circulation and encouraging strong growth. Training the trees ensures a strong structural form and better fruit yield.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Harvesting</h3>
        <p>Citrus fruits are harvested when they reach full size, color, and flavor. Hand-picking or clipping is done to avoid damage to the fruits and maintain quality.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Water Usage</h2>
      <p>Citrus trees require moderate but consistent watering for optimal growth.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water Requirements</h3>
        <p>Each citrus tree requires approximately 600–800 liters of water annually, depending on the climate and soil type.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Critical Stages for Water</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Flowering</li>
          <li>Fruit set</li>
          <li>Fruit development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Overwatering can lead to root rot, while water stress affects fruit yield and quality.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water-Saving Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drip Irrigation: Provides precise water delivery to the root zone.</li>
          <li>Rainwater Harvesting: Collects and stores rainwater for irrigation use.</li>
          <li>Mulching: Reduces evaporation and conserves moisture in the soil.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Suitable Soils for Citrus</h2>
      <p>Citrus plants thrive in well-drained loamy soils that allow proper root aeration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sandy Loam: Preferred for its excellent drainage capacity.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The optimal pH range for citrus cultivation is 6.0 to 7.5. Avoid heavy clay soils, which are prone to waterlogging, and saline or alkaline soils.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Difficulties in Citrus Cultivation</h2>
      <p>Citrus cultivation faces several challenges, including pest infestations, water stress, and poor pollination.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Pest and Disease Infestations</h3>
        <p>Common pests include citrus psylla, fruit flies, and aphids. Diseases like citrus canker, greening disease (HLB), and root rot can also reduce crop yield.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use pest-resistant and disease-free planting material, apply bio-pesticides, and practice Integrated Pest Management (IPM). Regularly inspect the trees and remove any infected parts.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Water Stress</h3>
        <p>Irregular watering can cause fruit cracking or drop.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use efficient irrigation methods like drip systems and monitor soil moisture to irrigate during critical stages.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Nutrient Deficiencies</h3>
        <p>Deficiencies in nitrogen, potassium, or micronutrients like zinc can affect growth and fruiting.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Conduct soil tests and apply appropriate fertilizers. Foliar sprays of micronutrients can address deficiencies quickly.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Soil Problems</h3>
        <p>Poor drainage can lead to root diseases.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Improve drainage by planting on raised beds or ridges. Use organic matter to enhance soil structure.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Climate Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>Frost, excessive heat, or prolonged drought can stress citrus trees and reduce yields.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use frost protection techniques like mulching or sprinklers, and choose climate-adapted citrus varieties.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>f. Poor Pollination</h3>
        <p>Poor pollination can reduce fruit set.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Encourage pollinators such as bees by planting nectar-rich plants, and avoid spraying pesticides during flowering.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>g. Market Challenges</h3>
        <p>Price volatility and storage issues can affect citrus profitability.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Develop cold storage facilities to prolong shelf life and promote value-added products like citrus juices or jams.</p>
