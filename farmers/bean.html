      <h2>1. Mechanism of Beans Cultivation</h2>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Land Preparation</h3>
        <p>Plowing loosens the soil to improve aeration and root growth. The field is leveled for efficient water management, and organic compost or farmyard manure is added to enrich the soil.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Seed Selection and Planting</h3>
        <p>Select high-yield, disease-resistant bean varieties. The planting time for beans depends on the season:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Kharif season (rainy): June–July</li>
          <li>Rabi season (winter): October–November</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Spacing should be 30–45 cm between rows and 10–15 cm between plants, with a sowing depth of 2–5 cm for optimal germination.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Crop Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Beans require consistent moisture, especially during flowering and pod development. Regular weeding, either manually or chemically, ensures a weed-free field. Fertilization with nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) fertilizers, along with inoculation of seeds with Rhizobium bacteria, enhances nitrogen fixation and improves soil fertility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Harvesting</h3>
        <p>For fresh beans, harvest when pods are tender and green. For dry beans, wait until the pods are mature and dry. Harvesting can be done manually for delicate handling or mechanically for large-scale farming.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Water Usage</h2>
      <p>Beans have moderate water requirements and are highly sensitive to waterlogging and drought.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water Requirements</h3>
        <p>Beans typically need approximately 300–500 liters of water per kg, depending on the type (fresh or dry beans) and climate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Critical Stages for Water</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Germination</li>
          <li>Flowering</li>
          <li>Pod development</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Water stress during these stages can cause flower and pod drop, leading to reduced yield.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water-Saving Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drip Irrigation: Provides water directly to the roots, minimizing wastage.</li>
          <li>Mulching: Helps retain moisture and reduces evaporation.</li>
          <li>Rainwater Harvesting: Collect rainwater for irrigation during dry spells.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Suitable Soils for Beans</h2>
      <p>Beans prefer well-drained, loamy or sandy loam soils with moderate fertility. They grow best in soils with a pH range of 6.0 to 7.5.</p>
      <p>Heavy clay or saline soils are unsuitable due to poor drainage and nutrient imbalance.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Difficulties in Beans Cultivation</h2>
      <p>Beans, like all crops, face several cultivation challenges. Here are the common issues and their remedies:</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Pest and Disease Infestations</h3>
        <p>Common pests include aphids, bean fly, pod borers, and whiteflies. Diseases like anthracnose, rust, and bacterial blight can also cause damage.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use pest- and disease-resistant varieties, apply biological control agents, and adopt Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies. Fungicides and insecticides can be used as necessary.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Water Stress</h3>
        <p>Excess water can cause root rot, while drought can affect flowering and pod filling.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Ensure proper drainage to avoid waterlogging. Use efficient irrigation techniques like drip systems to maintain consistent moisture levels during dry periods.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Nutrient Deficiency</h3>
        <p>A lack of nitrogen, phosphorus, or potassium can significantly reduce yield.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use balanced fertilizers based on soil test results. Inoculate seeds with nitrogen-fixing bacteria to improve soil fertility naturally.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Poor Pollination</h3>
        <p>Inadequate pollination can lead to poor pod set and reduced yield.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Plant beans in areas with adequate pollinator activity, and avoid pesticide spraying during flowering to protect pollinators.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Climate Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>Beans are sensitive to extreme temperatures, frost, or heavy rains, which can damage the crop.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Plant beans during favorable weather conditions and use protective structures like row covers in case of frost.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>f. Weed Competition</h3>
        <p>Weeds compete for nutrients, water, and sunlight, reducing bean yield.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Regular manual weeding, mechanical weeding, or the use of pre-emergence herbicides can control weed growth. Mulching also helps suppress weeds.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>g. Post-Harvest Losses</h3>
        <p>Improper drying and storage of beans can lead to spoilage and quality loss.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Dry beans thoroughly before storage to reduce moisture content and store them in cool, dry conditions to prevent fungal growth and pest infestations.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>h. Market Price Fluctuations</h3>
        <p>Beans are subject to price volatility, which can impact profitability for farmers.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Promote value-added products like canned beans or bean flour. Also, develop storage facilities to regulate market supply and demand, helping stabilize prices.</p>
