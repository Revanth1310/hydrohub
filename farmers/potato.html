      <h2>1. Mechanism of Potato Cultivation</h2>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Land Preparation</h3>
        <p>The soil is plowed to a fine tilth for better root penetration and tuber formation. Raised beds or ridges are created to facilitate drainage and tuber development. Organic manure or compost is applied to enhance soil fertility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Seed Selection and Planting</h3>
        <p>Healthy, disease-free seed tubers with 2–3 buds are selected for planting. The recommended depth is 5–10 cm, with 20–25 cm spacing between plants and 60–75 cm between rows. Planting is done manually or with mechanical planters for larger farms.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Crop Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Hilling soil around the base of plants prevents greening and exposure of tubers. Frequent light irrigation is necessary to maintain uniform moisture levels, and weeding is essential for proper nutrient availability.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Harvesting</h3>
        <p>Potatoes are harvested manually or with mechanized harvesters once the foliage turns yellow and dies back. Curing is performed after harvest to harden the skin for better storage.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Water Usage</h2>
      <p>Potatoes need consistent moisture but are sensitive to overwatering or waterlogging, which can affect tuber quality.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water Requirements</h3>
        <p>Approximately 300–500 liters of water per kg of potatoes.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Critical Stages for Water</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Tuber initiation</li>
          <li>Tuber bulking stage</li>
          <li>Over-irrigation or uneven watering can cause poor tuber quality.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water-Saving Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drip Irrigation: Delivers precise moisture to the root zone.</li>
          <li>Sprinkler Systems: Ensures even water distribution.</li>
          <li>Mulching: Helps conserve moisture and reduce evaporation.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Suitable Soils for Potatoes</h2>
      <p>Potatoes grow best in light, well-drained soils with good aeration.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Sandy Loam or Loamy Soil: Ensures easy tuber expansion and harvesting.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The optimal pH range for potato cultivation is 5.0 to 7.5. Excessively clayey or waterlogged soils should be avoided.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Difficulties in Potato Cultivation</h2>
      <p>Potato cultivation faces several challenges including water stress, pest infestations, and storage difficulties.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Water Stress</h3>
        <p>Excess or insufficient water can lead to poor tuber formation or rot.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use irrigation systems like drip irrigation to maintain moisture levels and avoid waterlogging.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Pest and Disease Infestations</h3>
        <p>Common pests include aphids, potato tuber moths, and cutworms. Diseases like late blight and bacterial wilt are also prevalent.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Grow resistant varieties, use IPM (Integrated Pest Management), and apply fungicides and bio-control agents.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Soil Nutrient Depletion</h3>
        <p>Continuous potato cultivation exhausts soil fertility.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Rotate crops with legumes or cereals to restore nutrients, and apply balanced fertilizers and organic matter.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Climate Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>Potatoes are sensitive to extreme temperatures, frost, and prolonged dry spells.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Time planting and harvesting to avoid frost and heat stress. Use mulching to regulate soil temperature.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Weed Competition</h3>
        <p>Weeds compete with potatoes for nutrients, water, and light.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use pre- and post-emergence herbicides, and perform regular manual or mechanical weeding.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>f. Storage Challenges</h3>
        <p>Potatoes are prone to sprouting and rotting during storage.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Store potatoes in cool, dark, and well-ventilated conditions, and use sprout inhibitors for long-term storage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>g. Market Price Fluctuations</h3>
        <p>Potato prices are volatile, affecting farmer income.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Process potatoes into value-added products like chips or starch, and develop storage facilities to reduce post-harvest losses.</p>
