      <h2>1. Mechanism of Sugarcane Cultivation</h2>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Land Preparation</h3>
        <p>Soil is deeply plowed and leveled for proper water management. Fields are prepared with ridges and furrows to aid irrigation and drainage.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Planting</h3>
        <p>Healthy sugarcane setts (stem pieces with buds) are used as planting material. Planting methods include flat planting for areas with sufficient rainfall and trench planting for water-scarce regions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Crop Maintenance</h3>
        <p>Regular irrigation, weeding, and balanced fertilizers are applied. The crop is kept healthy through careful maintenance.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Harvesting</h3>
        <p>Sugarcane is harvested manually or mechanically, and the crop is cut close to the ground to ensure regrowth from ratoons.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Water Usage</h2>
      <p>Sugarcane requires a significant amount of water. On average, it takes 1,500â€“2,500 liters of water to produce 1 kg of sugar.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Critical Stages for Water</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Germination</li>
          <li>Tillering</li>
          <li>Elongation</li>
          <li>Grand growth stage</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water-Saving Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Drip Irrigation</li>
          <li>Trash Mulching</li>
          <li>Intercropping</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Suitable Soils for Sugarcane</h2>
      <p>Sugarcane thrives in loamy, clayey, and alluvial soils. The soil pH should be between 6.5 and 8.5 for optimal growth.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Difficulties in Sugarcane Cultivation</h2>
      <p>Sugarcane cultivation faces several challenges, including water scarcity, pests, soil degradation, and climate sensitivity.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Water Scarcity</h3>
        <p>Water scarcity can be remedied through efficient irrigation and rainwater harvesting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Pest and Disease Infestations</h3>
        <p>Top shoot borers, termites, and whiteflies can damage crops. Disease-resistant varieties and Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategies can help.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Soil Degradation</h3>
        <p>Continuous cultivation depletes soil nutrients. Crop rotation with legumes and using organic manures helps restore fertility.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Climate Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>Extreme weather conditions can harm sugarcane growth. Drought-resistant varieties and optimized planting schedules can mitigate this.</p>
