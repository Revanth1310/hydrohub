      <h2>1. Mechanism of Wheat Cultivation</h2>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Land Preparation</h3>
        <p>The field is plowed to loosen the soil for aeration and root penetration. The field is leveled to ensure even water distribution during irrigation. A fine seedbed is prepared to facilitate uniform germination.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Sowing</h3>
        <p>Wheat is sown during cool, dry seasons, usually in late October to November. The seed rate is approximately 100–125 kg per hectare. Methods include broadcasting seeds manually or mechanically, and line sowing using seed drills for uniform spacing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Irrigation</h3>
        <p>Wheat requires timely irrigation during critical growth stages. The irrigation frequency depends on soil type and climate conditions.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Fertilizer Application</h3>
        <p>Balanced application of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium (NPK) fertilizers is essential. Micronutrients like zinc may also be added based on soil testing.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Weed Control</h3>
        <p>Weed control is managed using manual weeding, herbicides, or mechanized tools to ensure the crop grows undisturbed.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>f. Harvesting</h3>
        <p>Wheat is harvested manually with sickles or mechanically with combine harvesters. Threshing separates the grain from the straw.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>2. Water Usage</h2>
      <p>Wheat requires less water compared to crops like rice and sugarcane, making it suitable for semi-arid regions.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water Requirements</h3>
        <p>Wheat requires approximately 450–650 liters of water per kg of wheat.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Critical Stages for Water</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Crown root initiation (20-25 days after sowing)</li>
          <li>Tillering stage</li>
          <li>Flowering stage</li>
          <li>Grain filling stage</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>Water-Saving Techniques</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>Sprinkler Irrigation: Evenly distributes water, reducing wastage.</li>
          <li>Drip Irrigation: Directly supplies water to roots, minimizing evaporation losses.</li>
          <li>Zero Tillage: Retains soil moisture and reduces water requirements.</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>3. Suitable Soils for Wheat</h2>
      <p>Wheat grows best in well-drained loamy soils with moderate fertility.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Alluvial Soil: Ideal in river basins for its fertility and moisture retention.</li>
        <li>Clay-Loam Soil: Retains moisture but requires proper drainage.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>The optimal soil pH is between 6.0 and 7.5.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
      <h2>4. Difficulties in Wheat Cultivation</h2>
      <p>Several challenges affect wheat cultivation. These include climate sensitivity, water scarcity, pests, soil fertility decline, and weed infestation.</p>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>a. Climate Sensitivity</h3>
        <p>High temperatures during the grain-filling period can reduce yield. Frost during flowering affects pollination.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Plant heat- and drought-resistant wheat varieties and use weather-based advisory systems for timely sowing and irrigation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>b. Water Scarcity</h3>
        <p>Limited availability of irrigation water can affect productivity.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Use water-saving technologies like drip and sprinkler irrigation and promote rainwater harvesting.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>c. Pest and Disease Infestation</h3>
        <p>Common pests include rust, blight, and aphids.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Grow disease-resistant wheat varieties and implement Integrated Pest Management (IPM) techniques.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>d. Soil Fertility Decline</h3>
        <p>Continuous wheat cultivation depletes soil nutrients.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Rotate wheat with legumes to enhance soil fertility and apply organic manures and bio-fertilizers.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>e. Weed Infestation</h3>
        <p>Weeds compete with wheat for nutrients and water.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Apply pre- and post-emergence herbicides, and practice timely manual or mechanical weeding.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="subsection">
        <h3>f. Market Price Fluctuations</h3>
        <p>Wheat prices are subject to global supply and demand fluctuations, which affect farmer income.</p>
        <p><strong>Remedies:</strong> Provide Minimum Support Prices (MSP) and develop local storage and processing facilities to add value.</p>
